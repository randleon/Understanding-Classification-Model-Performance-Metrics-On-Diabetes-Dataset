# Understanding-Classification-Model-Performance-Metrics-On-Diabetes-Dataset


Evaluation of the performance of classification models can be facilitated through a combination of calculating certain
types of performance metrics and generating model performance evaluation graphics. 
The purpose of this exercise is to calculate a suite of classification model performance metrics via Python code functions and then compare the results to those of pre-built Python functions that automatically calculate
those same metrics. 

Graphical output via Python code was used to evaluate
the performance of classification models.
